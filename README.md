PathoAgent: The first systematic Agentic AI framework for digital pathology, orchestrating multi-agent collaboration (WSI, IHC, Molecular, Radiology-Pathology) with evidence-based knowledge retrieval from WHO 2024 and NCCN/CAP guidelines.

**Core Features**
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Central orchestrator coordinating five specialist agents for multimodal reasoning (morphology, biomarkers, molecular, radiology-pathology correlation, and diagnostic fusion)
- **Knowledge-Enhanced**: Real-time retrieval from vectorized clinical guidelines with auto-citation and evidence-level grading
- **Zero-Cost Integration**: Standardized API wrappers enabling legacy pathology AI model incorporation without retraining
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: CAP-compliant three-level quality control ensuring pathologist oversight at critical decision points
- **Rapid Deployment**: BPMN workflow orchestration reducing complex diagnostic pipeline deployment from months to days

**Status**: Active development • Last updated: 2026-02-27
